# React Portfolio 

## Description

Being a web developer means being part of a community. I needed a place to share my projects and my work so that I can work with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects. I wanted to build a portfolio using the latest technologies available to showcase my work. This portfolio will also be great for applying for jobs or showing my work as a freelancer. I chose to build my portfolio using React as it is a widely used in-demand framework. Using React components will allow me to easily add and edit the data in my portfolio which will help me to continuously improve my application. 

## Installation

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Open the file and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. 
3. Run `npm run start` to view the portfolio on `localhost:3000`.
