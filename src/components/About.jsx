            <p>
            I'm dedicated to learning, problem solving and having fun, which has led me here! Currently a student in Salt Lake City attending 
            University of Utah coding bootcamp to become a full stack web developer who will thrive on turning ideas into digital reality. 
            Beyond the screen, you'll catch me furthering my education or mastering the art of skateboarding. I find inspiration outdoors, 
            cooking new meals, and sharing the journey with my two canine companions Ozzy and Nollie. Let's connect and collaborate to bring
            innovative web solutions to life! ðŸ’»âœ¨
